    <h1>Design Challenge One</h1>
    <h2>What two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

    <p>Websites that inspire me range from the simple and modern, like LA-based photographer <a href="http://www.bonnietsang.com/" target="_blank">Bonnie Tsang's website</a> to the extremely stylistic like SF bar <a href="http://www.bourbonandbranch.com/">Bourbon and Branch's website</a></p>

    <h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
    
    <p>Bonnie's website, while simple is also true to her style. She utilizes the negative space to keep focus on her photographs. The excess of white space, allow the color of her photographs to be further contrasted. The size of the three photographs within the center of the website draws the eye immediately to the services she is selling-- her skill as a photographer. Keeping the fonts simple keeps to the modern aesthetic of the site while insuring the reader can easily navigate.</p>

    <p>Bourbon and Branch's website attempts to create a period-like experience for their user, true to the experience they are trying to create for the customer in their establishment. It utilizes negative space to draw the user into the center of the website- and points out the next possible places for the user to navigate. While there are apprently three immages on the landing page, clicking on either one will land you to their true homepage. There, they ultilize a grid design to help the user navigate the site, balancing a text heavy right-hand columne with an image saturated left.</p>

     <h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

     <p>Similarities between Bonnie and Bourban and Branch's website is their shared use of negative space to highlight things as well their general adherence to the grid designs.</p>

     <p>Differences between the two websites are very obsiously their styles. Bonnie's is simple-- lots of white, with modern texts to guide you to other pages for information. Bourbon and Branch kept their website ambiance by overlapping text with images to create a darker, mysterious mood. They also ultized a more stylized font to emulate the era experience they are trying to recreate.</p>
    
    <h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>Thumbnail sketch <b>One</b><br>
    	<img src="images/wireframe1.jpg" alt="Thumbnail One" title="Fun One" height="50%" width="50%"><br>
      <p> The focal point on this thumbnail draws to the circle, which in a sea of squares, stands out the most. The nagative space at the top of the pages helps to emphasize the heading and the introduction of the page, very loudly announcing this page's intentions.</p></li>
      <li>Thumbnail sketch <b>Two</b><br>
      <img src="images/wireframe2.jpg" alt="Thumbnail Two" title="Fun Two" height="50%" width="50%"/>
      <p>The page is designed to draw the user into the center of the page first. The dominant trio of images in the center engages the user to click; thus rendering labels to be unnecessary. This design announces the page's intention subtly, in imagine in lieu of text.</p></li>
    </ul>
